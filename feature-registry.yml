known_options:
  dsn:
    name: "DSN"
    description: |
      The DSN tells the SDK where to send the events. If this value is not set the SDK
      will not send any events.
  release:
    name: "Release Version"
    description:
      Sets the release version.
  environment:
    name: "Environment Name"
    description:
      Sets the environment name.
  debug:
    name: "Debug Mode"
    default: false
    description: |
      Turns debug mode on or off. If debug is enabled SDK will attempt to print out useful
      debugging information if something goes wrong with sending the event. The default
      is always `false`. It's generally not recommended to turn it on in production,
      though turning debug mode on will not cause any safety concerns.
  diagnostic-level:
    name: "Diagnostic Level"
    description: |
      Enabling debug mode makes the SDK generate as much diagnostic data as possible.
      However, if you'd prefer to lower the verbosity of the Sentry SDK diagnostics logs,
      configure this option to set the appropriate level.
  sample-rate:
    name: "Sample Rate"
    description: |
      Configures the sample rate for error events, in the range of 0.0 to 1.0. The default
      is 1.0 which means that 100% of error events are sent. If set to 0.1 only 10% of
      error events will be sent. Events are picked randomly.
